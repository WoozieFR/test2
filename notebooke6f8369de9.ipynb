For instance, consider the Kaggle [U.S. Patent Phrase to Phrase Matching](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/us-patent-phrase-to-phrase-matching/) competition. In this, we are tasked with comparing two words or short phrases, and scoring them based on whether they're similar or not, based on which patent class they were used in. With a score of `1` it is considered that the two inputs have identical meaning, and `0` means they have totally different meaning. For instance, *abatement* and *eliminating process* have a score of `0.5`, meaning they're somewhat similar, but not identical.\n",

According to the definition of Buzan T. and Buzan B. (1999, Dessine-moi  l'intelligence. Paris: Les Éditions d'Organisation.), the mind map (or heuristic diagram) is a graphic  representation technique that follows the natural functioning of the mind and allows the brain's  potential to be released. Cf Annex1\\n\\nThis tool has many advantages:\\n\\n•  It is accessible to all and does not require significant material investment and can be done  quickly\\n\\n•  It is scalable\\n\\n•  It allows categorization and linking of information\\n\\n•  It can be applied to any type of situation: notetaking, problem solving, analysis, creation of  new ideas\\n\\n•  It is suitable for all people and is easy to learn\\n\\n•  It is fun and encourages exchanges\\n\\n•  It makes visible the dimension of projects, opportunities, interconnections\\n\\n•  It synthesizes\\n\\n•  It makes the project understandable\\n\\n•  It allows you to explore ideas\\n\\nThe creation of a mind map starts with an idea/problem located at its center. This starting point  generates ideas/work areas, incremented around this center in a radial structure, which in turn is  completed with as many branches as new ideas.\\n\\nThis tool enables creativity and logic to be mobilized, it is a map of the thoughts.\\n\\nCreativity is enhanced because participants feel comfortable with the method.\\n\\nApplication & Insight\\n\\nI start the process of the mind map creation with the stakeholders standing around a large board  (white or paper board). In the center of the board, I write and highlight the topic to design.\\n\\nThrough a series of questions, I guide the stakeholders in modelling the mind map. I adapt the series  of questions according to the topic to be addressed. In the type of questions, we can use: who, what,  when, where, why, how, how much.\\n\\nThe use of the “why” is very interesting to understand the origin. By this way, the interviewed person  frees itself from paradigms and thus dares to propose new ideas / ways of functioning. I plan two  hours for a workshop.\\n\\nDesign Thinking for innovation reflexion-Avril 2021-Nathalie Sylla\\n\\nAfter modelling the mind map on paper, I propose to the participants a digital visualization of their  work with the addition of color codes, images and interconnections. This second workshop also lasts  two hours and allows the mind map to evolve. Once familiarized with it, the stakeholders discover  the power of the tool. Then, the second workshop brings out even more ideas and constructive  exchanges between the stakeholders. Around this new mind map, they have learned to work  together and want to make visible the untold ideas.\\n\\nI now present all the projects I manage in this type of format in order to ease rapid understanding for  decision-makers. These presentations are the core of my business models. The decision-makers are  thus able to identify the opportunities of the projects and can take quick decisions to validate them.  They find answers to their questions thank to a schematic representation.\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nWhat I find amazing with the facilitation of this type of workshop is the participants commitment for  the project. This tool helps to give meaning. The participants appropriate the story and want to keep  writing it. Then, they easily become actors or sponsors of the project. A trust relationship is built,  thus facilitating the implementation of related actions.\\n\\nDesign Thinking for innovation reflexion-Avril 2021-Nathalie Sylla\\n\\nAnnex 1: Mind Map Shared facilities project\\n\\n   \n",

As  a result of a poorly implemented linear solution, a more customer centric approach was  needed.\\n\\nAfter learning about design thinking in this course, we decided to apply it to solve this  problem. The visualization tool allowed the team to create a dynamic presentation using  diagrams, figures and drawings on the go that really resonated among the stakeholders.  Previous to this change, none of our solutions seemed to be adequate for them, but the  new implementation created a different type of connection with them that helped them  understand the problem in the way the team and I did.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nThe process starts in the prep time. The team uses a series of tools and software to  develop a presentation using the surveys gathered during research and the solutions we  created during the process. The use of graphs to quickly show statistics in a fully visual  way, rather than verbally was a game changer.\\n\\nAfter having a presentation prepared, the team hands an activity to the stakeholders,  where the solutions discussed previously appear. Nonetheless, the solutions need more  work to them. After this. The stakeholders are asked to help complete the solutions  while the team and I create diagrams on a blackboard to represent how their  suggestions would impact on this specific problem.\\n\\nThe use of a group activity strengthens the bond between the company and their  investors. It makes them feel like they take part and help solve the problems as well as  show how customer centric the solutions are. Every complaint and suggestion from  customers are read and evaluated using the graph shown in the course (Involving: can  we do it? Can we afford it? …). The finalization of this activity leaves the team and the  stakeholders on the same page. It allows them to completely understand and feel part  of the solution and also gives them the chance to ask better questions, which eases the  work of the team.\\n\\nInsight & Approach\\n\\nThe use of this method created a new workflow in the Design Team. It increased the  productivity and the success rate as well as the customer/stakeholders satisfaction. The  use of the visualization tool created an engaged group of people who work together to\\n\\nDiego Estrada\\n\\nfind a solution based on their customer satisfaction. This solution is later revised and  tweaked with the help of the stakeholders who are deeply involved in the process.\\n\\nPresentations, graphics, and activities have added a huge increase in satisfaction. As a  company we also learnt that engaging different areas can be difficult because of the  varying levels of understanding, but when paired with the adequate process things just  flow.\\n\\n(This story is fictional and was created for solving the assignment)\\n\\n   \n",

The main responsibility of this new position was to weekly report the results\\n\\nfor the week and estimate the final results of the month of 4 countries and consolidated\\n\\nthose.\\n\\nWhen I was receiving the position, I went to visit my colleague, former Regional Controller,\\n\\nwho was promoted to Country CEO and now had interest conflicts of being the controller.\\n\\nThe process to consolidate the information of the 4 countries was that the country controllers\\n\\nsent him an email with the main figures for the week, he forwarded those to his country\\n\\naccountant who consolidated it, the accountant sent him the consolidated report and he\\n\\nfinally reported to the headquarters. The whole process took almost a full business day to\\n\\ncomplete.\\n\\nGiven that my responsibilities as Country CFO demanded more attention because my\\n\\ncountry had more operations, I decided to change the process in order to reduce the\\n\\nduration and to ensure standardization in the format, and actually, reduce the human\\n\\nintervention, making that the country controllers work directly in the consolidation file.\\n\\nSelection\\n\\nHaving in mind that there was a different kind of users of file, I select some of those to\\n\\ndetermine what was the main important things to take into account in the moment of the\\n\\nprocess of the information and the reading of the same. In that sense, we form a group of\\n\\nthe country controllers, country CEOs, IT guys, and people from the headquarters to find the\\n\\nbest solutions possible.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nFor the first lunch, we focused on the consolidation process in order to avoid the copy-paste\\n\\nprocesses and reducing the manual intervention so, we build an online application where all\\n\\nthe controllers fill the figure of their respective country, along with the comments. During the\\n\\nfirst week of the first stage, we sent the new report along with the old one, and after the\\n\\nmeeting with the headquarters team, we ask for a post-meeting review of the new format, all\\n\\nthe assistants provided their comments and suggestions that were the input for the next\\n\\nreport.\\n\\nFor the second lunch, we focused on the feedback received from the assistants to the review\\n\\nmeeting, we adjust the report and we were able to eliminate the old one. The final report\\n\\nincluded all the suggestions received but the best of all is that reduced the time investment\\n\\nfrom about 36 men hours to around 8, without missing any valuable information and\\n\\nincluding new data that the stakeholders appreciated so much.\\n\\nInsight\\n\\nWith the application of the learning launch tool, the controller’s team along with the main\\n\\nstakeholders identified different assumptions and designed tools to test these assumptions.\\n\\nOn the other hand, we found probable requirements from headquarters, expecting to find\\n\\nthat a more agile approach that improved the workflow, reduced the time investment of\\n\\neveryone in the team and that both our team and the key stakeholders were very satisfied\\n\\nwith the results of the exercise and the new report.\\n\\nThe final report was slightly different from what we anticipated, but the differences were\\n\\nmore related to form and a few topics to be included in the report.\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nDespite that, the team was not used to design thinking tools, they were able to work with the\\n\\nlearning launch that was the appropriate tool. The team needs to review the insight gained\\n\\nfrom our first two launches and continuously evaluate this insight and new ones into future\\n\\nlaunch designs, especially taking into account that the full automation of the reports will take\\n\\nat least 4 years more according to the ERP implementation plan of the headquarter.\\n\\n   \n",

This tool is useful for me to have a clearer vision\\n\\nof the current state of the company and what it ultimately requires;\\n\\nthrough this tool I can deduce the personalities of the two investors, such\\n\\nas George and Geoff; and based on this I can make the best decision.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nIn the application of my chosen tool to the challenge that I have set\\n\\nmyself, the tool has been of a very wide utility, since when applying it to\\n\\nmy challenge very good results were obtained, since with this I could have\\n\\nan analysis to the measure of the two investors. The first thing I did with\\n\\nmy visualization tool was to conduct a study to customers who required\\n\\nthe flagship product of the company, first I had to understand why the\\n\\ndemand had had such a strong growth in the last two months, by applying\\n\\nthe tool I could find the answers to this question; I could see that\\n\\ncustomers needed this product as it was, without any modification\\n\\nbecause the product worked wonders.\\n\\nWith this study of the clients interested in the product, I was able to\\n\\nanalyze and follow up on the proposals I had on the table from the two\\n\\ninvestors.\\n\\nI concluded that I needed the person who was interested in the first\\n\\ninstance to supply the product that was having great success. Which was\\n\\nthe second investor, since he was interested in first of all to give the size\\n\\nof production that our customers demanded, and then worry about\\n\\nimproving it, but in small and concise steps.\\n\\nI discarded the first investor, as he did not meet the requirements that the\\n\\ncompany needed at that time. I realized that this investor was convinced\\n\\nthat by changing the product to the way he thought, the demand was\\n\\ngoing to increase more; but in reality what the company needed was to be\\n\\nable to cover the demand that the product was having, this investor\\n\\nwanted to throw everything we had, to the side of the road, but he did not\\n\\nthink for a moment that these modifications should have a low impact in\\n\\ncase things do not go as well as expected.\\n\\nThanks to the application of the tool I was able to identify the key points\\n\\nof the company's needs and how each investor, according to their\\n\\nproposals, could help me, based on this I made the best decision. I chose\\n\\nto work with the second investor, we were able to supply the demand for\\n\\nthe product, then the investment tripled and we were able to inject it into\\n\\nresearch for product innovation, and make some small changes, which\\n\\nwere being introduced to customers discreetly and in small quantities.\\n\\nWhen customers became more interested in the improved product, we\\n\\ndecided to increase production by improving the product.\\n\\nPerspective\\n\\nThe information and the final lesson that I had when socializing what we\\n\\nobtained by using the visualization tool, the first thing is that we must\\n\\nalways think first about the needs of customers, of the people interested\\n\\nin the product; it is very useful to know what the problem is, what is the\\n\\ncause of the problem and finally build an effective solution. Secondly,\\n\\nbased on what we have obtained, we can find a partner that fits our\\n\\nneeds, and be able to work as a team, unifying ideas and producing\\n\\npossible solutions. Thanks to the knowledge gained from the design\\n\\ncourse, I was able to create a strategic plan for the company's problems\\n\\nand make it a successful plan.\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nWhat I would apply differently in the challenge would be the tool used, I\\n\\nwould like to use the learning launch; I would do it in the following way,\\n\\nrejecting the proposals of the two investors and only creating the way that\\n\\nthe production process would be decreased to be able to supply the\\n\\nrequired demand. It may or may not work out, but I would like to have\\n\\nemployed this strategy.\\n\\n   \n",
              "4     Assignment:  Visualization Reflection  Submitted by: Nadine Born  Course:  Design Thinking for Innovation    Trail Challenge: To Build or Not to Build    An environmental charity wanted to conduct a fundraising campaign to raise $4 million to build a  public path in a busy tourist area of a small town in British Columbia, Canada. They had been gifted a  large piece of land by a local landowner, which was a substantial gift and prevented them from  needing to purchase the land, however, they still needed to raise a large amount of money in order to  pay for the supplies and labor to build the trail.     Even though the local community appeared to be supportive of the trail, they could not provide  enough money from private donations to build it. If the summer vacation property owners did not  provide some funding, then there was a strong possibility that they would not raise enough money to  complete the trail. The charity did not know if the community as a whole would support the project  and needed to conduct testing with key influencers and potential donors to gauge their interest.  Building the trail without testing the support first was too risky because the charity did not have  enough money in reserve to cover the cost of the trail if the fundraising efforts were not successful.     Tool Selection: Visualization    Visualization is the process of “assembling scattered ideas into a compelling story that can generate  vivid mental images” (Designing for Growth, p49).  As the consultant for the study, I chose  visualization because the charity had a firm concept of why they needed the trail, how it would  benefit the town, and how much it would cost but needed a persuasive way to tie it all together. The  business case for the project was strong but without a tool to help them illustrate how the trail would  positively impact the residents, there was little chance people would donate enough to meet the  budget. We needed a tool that provided a “head and heart” message to convince people to support  the project. Visualization provided the perfect combination of key messaging, beautiful photography,  architectural renderings, safety data, and budget criteria to create the vision for the project in an  easy‐to‐read document that was only four pages in length. Visualization allowed us to describe the  urgent and compelling need for the trail in a succinct and tangible way.     Application    Once we drafted the vision document, we worked with the charity to identify a list of people whose  opinion would be important to the success (or failure) of the fundraising campaign. The list included  past and potential donors, key influencers in the community such as large landowners and business  owners, affluent summer‐only residents, and elected officials. We requested one‐hour meetings with  all of the people on the list. If people did not want to meet with us in person, which was often the\\n\\ncase with the part‐time residents, we offered to conduct the meetings by phone. When someone  agreed to meet with us, we emailed them the vision document so they could read it in advance and  prepare their questions. This created a good environment for an informed and candid dialogue.    While the scheduling of the interviews was in progress, we designed a questionnaire to guide our  discussions. Consistently using the questionnaire ensured that we covered the same questions with all  the interviewees. The goal was to speak with 20 – 25 key influencers in the community and gauge  their interest in, or opposition to, supporting the fundraising efforts for the trail as either donors or  campaign volunteers or both. We successfully met with 24 interviewees and compiled the feedback  into a summary report along with recommendations for the charity. The entire process took three  months.    Insight    Fundraising and design thinking both require a willingness to adapt and fail fast. Good fundraisers are  responsive to their donors and design thinking serves as the perfect platform to plan and launch new  fundraising initiatives; it is an ideal methodology for solving complex philanthropic issues. We are not  formally taught design thinking models in fundraising classes but they should be added to the  curriculum.     Although it is not explicitly stated in the course videos, it occurred to me that both fundraising and  design thinking are rooted in communication and relationships and both are iterative processes based  on testing and investigation. The elusive synergy between art and science is as beautifully illustrated  by design thinking as it is as inherent in daily fundraising practice.      Improvements for Next Time    Visualization was an effective tool in this circumstance and I would use it again in a similar situation.  However, it would also be enlightening to create a journey map with a wide spectrum of people from  the town because there were many assumptions made during the visualization process about how the  trail would be used and what benefits would be desired by the tourists, local public, and sponsors.  Journey mapping would have confirmed the validity of those assumptions and supplemented the data  gathered during the interviews.     The other tool that I would use next time in conjunction with visualization is storytelling. I would take  someone’s first hand account of the situation and create a short video to showcase the urgency of the  project or program from his/her perspective. A link to the video would be included in the email about  the interview along with a PDF of the vision document. I think this would provide a holistic micro and  macro perspective to the exercise and spark some interesting conversations in the interviews.\\n\\n   \n",

As a result of the codvid pandemic and  the restrictions that are in place until now, sales fell. delivery personnel had to be fired and operations  slowed down. There are restrictions for the sale of products in store. Although deliveries are made at  home and at no additional cost, sales do not go up. The option to reduce the price of the product was not  an option, there had been product promotions without great variations in sales    THE SELECTION     We provide solutions through the design thinking method with the aim of increasing sales. but lacking  quantitative information, we opted for a journey map as a tool. We carry out the research with regular  customers of the products. The journey map was done with 4 costumers.      THE APPLICATION     For the application of the jurney map we contacted frequent clients, who through interviews via ZOOM  could not be face-to-face due to bio-security measures, key questions were asked and they were used to  show the benefits of the products. The discoveries when talking directly with our clients generated several  hypotheses. We were somehow advancing what would be WHAT IF ?.  The results generated in the  interviews and through the journal map we were able to do interviews every other day, for a week 15  minutes. the new normal allows us to be flexible in our research methods.  In a next meeting and with the  results obtained, we opted for some ideas for rapid implementation.      INSIGHT & APPROACH    The information collected from our clients was very valuable. Despite the quarantine, they continued to  buy the products.\\n\\n•  underlying diseases (reunatism, joint pain)\\n\\n•  Being natural products, our clients felt that they were better than chemical ones.\\n\\n•  Customers knew that the products we sold were fortified with VITAMINS A B C E D OMEGA  3.\\n\\n•  in times of codvid,  is necessary to reinforce the immune system with vitamins.\\n\\nThey valued that the delivery personnel have biosecurity measures in the deliveries of the product.    The data we obtained led us to make the decision to make a change in communication on social networks,  which is the channel through which more sales are made.    We made multimedia material showing the staff making the deliveries with all the biosafety measures, we  made more emphasis on the consumption of the product as a vitamin supplement, which in addition to  doing good for basic diseases were reinforced with vitamins.    Carrying out these two actions obtained from the journey maps and interviews with clients, they gave us  enough feedback and insights to better analyze how to arrive objectively in the communication of the  product.    Although we have not yet had an exponential increase in sales, the level of inquiries about potential  customers has risen, which indicates that we are on the right track. The non-traditional tools that design  thinking gives us are applicable and flexible even for small businesses such as my wife.\\n\\n   \n",

In contrast to the  traditional, linear notes you might make in a text document or even on paper,  mind maps let you capture thoughts, ideas and keywords on a blank canvas.  These ideas are organized in a two-dimensional structure, with the title/main  idea always located in the center of the map for visibility. Related ideas branch  off from the center in all directions, creating a radiant structure.\\n\\nDespite these key principles, the fact that mind mapping has existed for almost  half a century makes it inevitable that some divergence will exist when it comes  to defining what a mind map actually is.\\n\\nmind mapping is a particular technique that requires the following key elements  to be effective:\\n\\n• A central image, to stimulate memory, associations and thought\\n\\nprocesses\\n\\n• Curvilinear branches, emanating from the central image, to depict\\n\\nthe basic ordering ideas (BOIs)\\n\\n• A (theoretically infinite) network of smaller branches to depict ideas\\n\\nstemming from the BOIs at different levels of detail\\n\\n• Conscious use of color to separate ideas by topic\\n\\n• A single keyword for each branch\\n\\nMany purists argue to this day that his method remains the one true technique:  a map without the elements above cannot be considered a “true” mind map.\\n\\nWhen it comes to creating your mind map, the most important things to  consider are what you need and how you learn best. Sometimes, you may not  even need a mind map at all. While almost all mapping techniques were  developed as an alternative to long-form text and linear notes, there are plenty  of situations where linear note-taking is a perfectly suitable method.\\n\\nYour needs and goals should also be considered when you decide how to create  the mind map itself. While traditional paper mind maps are great for developing  ideas by yourself, the development of online mind mapping tools has enabled  millions of people to brainstorm and plan together in real time. It’s for this  reason that MindMeister, our very own online mind mapping tool, features such  an intense focus on collaboration and group work.\\n\\n   \n",

We were given  the challenge to formulate a Business plan. The challenges they faced were Brand positioning,  market penetration, and customer segmentation of the target market. As the start-up was  targeting a very niche market, there wasn’t much data available on the same. So, we faced a  challenge wherein no other similar business was in-place to take as a reference. The outline  of the project was to get candidates specifically from PSU (Government-run organization) to  enroll for the mentorship program to pursue higher education\\n\\nSelection\\n\\nDue to a lack of data and a similar business model, we realized that Storytelling would be a  crucial tool in conveying our project effectively. We felt that we need to ignite and unite our  mentors to make our customers believe. We also felt that connecting with people and their  emotions, as conveyed in the Storytelling tool video, would enable us to understand them  better and our project as well.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nSince there was no data available with us, we decided to perform some research and generate  our data by interviewing some immediate stakeholders like current PSU employees and  mentors since mentors have traversed through the same path. We found many crucial  insights through this activity. We also got some hard facts based on which we started to build  some recommendations. By the time we came up with some suggestions, we had realized we  need to build suspense to develop their interest. Therefore, we started re-collecting the  “Ahaa” moments that we experienced while solving problems related to various aspects of  the B-plan discussed above. We began to design our presentation by making a concerted  effort to get our audience in the frame of mind, which we required them to be.\\n\\nThrough these insights and planned efforts, we were able to deliver a presentation that  connected with our mentors who had been through a similar path. Before addressing every  problem (Brand positioning, market penetration, and customer segmentation of the target  market), we built suspense before addressing that issue. Hence, our panelists were always  interested and on the edge of their seats. Due to this, we were able to deliver an effective  solution to our panelists and deliver it in a way that connected well with the mentors as well.  We eventually won a pre-placement offer from the start-up.\\n\\nInsights\\n\\nAfter the presentation, we saw that some other submissions had similar recommendations,  but the way we designed and conveyed our work, in the form of a story with spikes laid out  in between, was admired and valued by the panelists and mentors. Hence, we realized that  the effective communication of an idea plays a vital role in conveying an idea.\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nAfter completing the course, I realized that we could have used Mind-mapping in conjunction  with Storytelling, which could have aligned our thoughts in a better way, and we could have  come up with better insights through structured thinking.\\n\\n   \n",

Its purpose is to invoke uninhibited thoughts and it can be  practiced by an individual or a group of people. Group should meet in a comfortable  environment equipped with stationery and feel free to throw any idea or thought, even those  that might seem ridiculous. It is very important that group is diverse and consist of people from  a wide range of backgrounds. Although this method focuses on quantity rather than quality,  creativity of ideas is highly desirable. Most important advantages of this technique are that  many ideas can be generated in a short time period, great deal of them can be put aside for  later projects, and it doesn’t require lots of resources.\\n\\nWhen my team faced the challenge to create a new, motivating mobile application that will  inspire users to set and accomplish their goals in life, this method proved to be an excellent  method to set the foundations. Team itself was consist of members from different parts of the  world and that also played pivotal role in the design process. All of my peers were familiar with  applications that were trying to solve the same problem statement: People tend to set goals to  improve their lives but very few manage to accomplish them. Since there were several similar  applications on the market already, the biggest challenge was to determine what can we do to  make our app better than the others. We found the answer to that question during the  brainstorming session, along with the ideas for several more features that will motivate users  and make our product stand out from the others.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nDuring the brainstorming session team generated lots of creative ideas. Then we organized  them into groups and subgroups in order to analyze all generated data. Having ideas organized  like that, it was much easier to evaluate them, compare them with the current state of the art,  predict their cost and feasibility, and finally, decide on which ones were the best. We came up  with the key solution to our problem statement. What we needed to make our app successful  was the instrument of encouragement. We also figured out how to motivate our users  gradually, which was very important because it usually takes time to accomplish a goal.\\n\\nInsight & Approach\\n\\nBrainstorming is a technique that never failed me in my experience so far. In this particular case  it had provided me and my team with lots of creative ideas which helped us form a set of  features for a new mobile application that can stand fresh and original against what was  currently on the market. Brainstorming method fosters collaboration, creativity, and  productivity. To ensure a successful outcome it is good to have an experienced  moderator to facilitate the session. Experienced moderator will know how to encourage  participants to come up with more ideas and how to build up on them. He will also keep in  mind that it is very important to have a well defined problem statement, and make sure that  focus stays on users that the group is trying to solve the problem for. That is something that we,  as we were unexperienced designers at that time, didn’t know. Although we had defined the  problem statement and kept focus on it, we could have completed a successful brainstorming  session in much less time if we had had an experienced facilitator to lead our group.\\n\\n   \n",

We have a  pretty short deadline to face this challenge, so we are thinking about testing all employees of the  department in one unique experiment.\\n\\nSelection\\n\\nOut of all design thinking tools that we could use in order to find an approach that shows us the way to  increase employee wellbeing, we have decided to use the mind mapping tool. This design thinking tool is  the most appropriate when the experiment aims at finding patterns in given data among the surveyed  people. What we want to extract with this method is a group of several personalities when thinking  about the key issues for corporate wellbeing, just as we saw in the MeYou Health Story in the Design  Thinking course.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nIn order to apply the mind-mapping tool in an effective manner, we handed out to all employees a blank  piece of paper and told them to draw an eight-portion pizza. Each of these portions had to be filled in  with a factor that the participant considered mostly essential for his/her wellbeing among the auditing  department, out of eight factors we listed to them. This means that the employees had to write eight  factors on each of their pizzas but, in case of considering one of those elements more important than  others, that element could be written in more than one portion, according to how critical it is in  comparison to the rest. The eight factors the participants had to consider for their portions were: career  potential, salary, balance with personal life, vacation periods, training financed by the firm, transport  provision to go to the office and return to home, the provision of meal tickets and other benefits of  working at the company such as online shopping discounts.\\n\\nAfter completing this task, the employees were ordered to gather in groups of six people and discuss  about why each of them had reached their conclusions about giving more importance to some factors  than others.\\n\\nInsights\\n\\nOnce the whole process mentioned above was finished, we found out that there were interesting  results, as patterns of data existed among the selected elements. We concluded that there were  different types of employee preferences, as those that selected career potential also tended to choose  salary and training paid by the firm. These employees, therefore, could be classified as a first prototype  of worker, which are more worried about having a successful professional career, rather than other  benefits.\\n\\nAnother clear pattern was showed when observing that those who chose balance with personal life  tended to also select vacation periods and transport to go and return from the office. We could  conclude, therefore, that this type of employee worries mostly about having time to spend with their  family. Finally, there were people that selected a mix of these elements, mainly the four most chosen  factors: balance with personal life, salary, vacation periods and career potential. The elements that were  less considered among candidates were transport provision and other benefits such as shopping  discounts.\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nI believe that this tool was accurate for measuring what people consider important for their wellbeing in  their company, because it gave us different points of view since we drew conclusions concerning diverse  kinds of personalities. Despite this, another valid tool that could fit in this experiment is visualization,  where pictures of a successful manager or a happy family would be shown, in order to see which result  more attractive for the candidates and conclusions would be drawn by stating the factors determining  wellbeing mentioned before, representing the opposite order of the process explained above.\\n\\n   \n",

According to the definition of Buzan T. and Buzan B. (1999, Dessine-moi  l'intelligence. Paris: Les Éditions d'Organisation.), the mind map (or heuristic diagram) is a graphic  representation technique that follows the natural functioning of the mind and allows the brain's  potential to be released. Cf Annex1\\n\\nThis tool has many advantages:\\n\\n•  It is accessible to all and does not require significant material investment and can be done  quickly\\n\\n•  It is scalable\\n\\n•  It allows categorization and linking of information\\n\\n•  It can be applied to any type of situation: notetaking, problem solving, analysis, creation of  new ideas\\n\\n•  It is suitable for all people and is easy to learn\\n\\n•  It is fun and encourages exchanges\\n\\n•  It makes visible the dimension of projects, opportunities, interconnections\\n\\n•  It synthesizes\\n\\n•  It makes the project understandable\\n\\n•  It allows you to explore ideas\\n\\nThe creation of a mind map starts with an idea/problem located at its center. This starting point  generates ideas/work areas, incremented around this center in a radial structure, which in turn is  completed with as many branches as new ideas.\\n\\nThis tool enables creativity and logic to be mobilized, it is a map of the thoughts.\\n\\nCreativity is enhanced because participants feel comfortable with the method.\\n\\nApplication &amp; Insight\\n\\nI start the process of the mind map creation with the stakeholders standing around a large board  (white or paper board). In the center of the board, I write and highlight the topic to design.\\n\\nThrough a series of questions, I guide the stakeholders in modelling the mind map. I adapt the series  of questions according to the topic to be addressed. In the type of questions, we can use: who, what,  when, where, why, how, how much.\\n\\nThe use of the “why” is very interesting to understand the origin. By this way, the interviewed person  frees itself from paradigms and thus dares to propose new ideas / ways of functioning. I plan two  hours for a workshop.\\n\\nDesign Thinking for innovation reflexion-Avril 2021-Nathalie Sylla\\n\\nAfter modelling the mind map on paper, I propose to the participants a digital visualization of their  work with the addition of color codes, images and interconnections. This second workshop also lasts  two hours and allows the mind map to evolve. Once familiarized with it, the stakeholders discover  the power of the tool. Then, the second workshop brings out even more ideas and constructive  exchanges between the stakeholders. Around this new mind map, they have learned to work  together and want to make visible the untold ideas.\\n\\nI now present all the projects I manage in this type of format in order to ease rapid understanding for  decision-makers. These presentations are the core of my business models. The decision-makers are  thus able to identify the opportunities of the projects and can take quick decisions to validate them.  They find answers to their questions thank to a schematic representation.\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nWhat I find amazing with the facilitation of this type of workshop is the participants commitment for  the project. This tool helps to give meaning. The participants appropriate the story and want to keep  writing it. Then, they easily become actors or sponsors of the project. A trust relationship is built,  thus facilitating the implementation of related actions.\\n\\nDesign Thinking for innovation reflexion-Avril 2021-Nathalie Sylla\\n\\nAnnex 1: Mind Map Shared facilities project\\n\\n</td>\n",

As  a result of a poorly implemented linear solution, a more customer centric approach was  needed.\\n\\nAfter learning about design thinking in this course, we decided to apply it to solve this  problem. The visualization tool allowed the team to create a dynamic presentation using  diagrams, figures and drawings on the go that really resonated among the stakeholders.  Previous to this change, none of our solutions seemed to be adequate for them, but the  new implementation created a different type of connection with them that helped them  understand the problem in the way the team and I did.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nThe process starts in the prep time. The team uses a series of tools and software to  develop a presentation using the surveys gathered during research and the solutions we  created during the process. The use of graphs to quickly show statistics in a fully visual  way, rather than verbally was a game changer.\\n\\nAfter having a presentation prepared, the team hands an activity to the stakeholders,  where the solutions discussed previously appear. Nonetheless, the solutions need more  work to them. After this. The stakeholders are asked to help complete the solutions  while the team and I create diagrams on a blackboard to represent how their  suggestions would impact on this specific problem.\\n\\nThe use of a group activity strengthens the bond between the company and their  investors. It makes them feel like they take part and help solve the problems as well as  show how customer centric the solutions are. Every complaint and suggestion from  customers are read and evaluated using the graph shown in the course (Involving: can  we do it? Can we afford it? …). The finalization of this activity leaves the team and the  stakeholders on the same page. It allows them to completely understand and feel part  of the solution and also gives them the chance to ask better questions, which eases the  work of the team.\\n\\nInsight &amp; Approach\\n\\nThe use of this method created a new workflow in the Design Team. It increased the  productivity and the success rate as well as the customer/stakeholders satisfaction. The  use of the visualization tool created an engaged group of people who work together to\\n\\nDiego Estrada\\n\\nfind a solution based on their customer satisfaction. This solution is later revised and  tweaked with the help of the stakeholders who are deeply involved in the process.\\n\\nPresentations, graphics, and activities have added a huge increase in satisfaction. As a  company we also learnt that engaging different areas can be difficult because of the  varying levels of understanding, but when paired with the adequate process things just  flow.\\n\\n(This story is fictional and was created for solving the assignment)\\n\\n</td>\n",

The main responsibility of this new position was to weekly report the results\\n\\nfor the week and estimate the final results of the month of 4 countries and consolidated\\n\\nthose.\\n\\nWhen I was receiving the position, I went to visit my colleague, former Regional Controller,\\n\\nwho was promoted to Country CEO and now had interest conflicts of being the controller.\\n\\nThe process to consolidate the information of the 4 countries was that the country controllers\\n\\nsent him an email with the main figures for the week, he forwarded those to his country\\n\\naccountant who consolidated it, the accountant sent him the consolidated report and he\\n\\nfinally reported to the headquarters. The whole process took almost a full business day to\\n\\ncomplete.\\n\\nGiven that my responsibilities as Country CFO demanded more attention because my\\n\\ncountry had more operations, I decided to change the process in order to reduce the\\n\\nduration and to ensure standardization in the format, and actually, reduce the human\\n\\nintervention, making that the country controllers work directly in the consolidation file.\\n\\nSelection\\n\\nHaving in mind that there was a different kind of users of file, I select some of those to\\n\\ndetermine what was the main important things to take into account in the moment of the\\n\\nprocess of the information and the reading of the same. In that sense, we form a group of\\n\\nthe country controllers, country CEOs, IT guys, and people from the headquarters to find the\\n\\nbest solutions possible.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nFor the first lunch, we focused on the consolidation process in order to avoid the copy-paste\\n\\nprocesses and reducing the manual intervention so, we build an online application where all\\n\\nthe controllers fill the figure of their respective country, along with the comments. During the\\n\\nfirst week of the first stage, we sent the new report along with the old one, and after the\\n\\nmeeting with the headquarters team, we ask for a post-meeting review of the new format, all\\n\\nthe assistants provided their comments and suggestions that were the input for the next\\n\\nreport.\\n\\nFor the second lunch, we focused on the feedback received from the assistants to the review\\n\\nmeeting, we adjust the report and we were able to eliminate the old one. The final report\\n\\nincluded all the suggestions received but the best of all is that reduced the time investment\\n\\nfrom about 36 men hours to around 8, without missing any valuable information and\\n\\nincluding new data that the stakeholders appreciated so much.\\n\\nInsight\\n\\nWith the application of the learning launch tool, the controller’s team along with the main\\n\\nstakeholders identified different assumptions and designed tools to test these assumptions.\\n\\nOn the other hand, we found probable requirements from headquarters, expecting to find\\n\\nthat a more agile approach that improved the workflow, reduced the time investment of\\n\\neveryone in the team and that both our team and the key stakeholders were very satisfied\\n\\nwith the results of the exercise and the new report.\\n\\nThe final report was slightly different from what we anticipated, but the differences were\\n\\nmore related to form and a few topics to be included in the report.\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nDespite that, the team was not used to design thinking tools, they were able to work with the\\n\\nlearning launch that was the appropriate tool.

This tool is useful for me to have a clearer vision\\n\\nof the current state of the company and what it ultimately requires;\\n\\nthrough this tool I can deduce the personalities of the two investors, such\\n\\nas George and Geoff; and based on this I can make the best decision.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nIn the application of my chosen tool to the challenge that I have set\\n\\nmyself, the tool has been of a very wide utility, since when applying it to\\n\\nmy challenge very good results were obtained, since with this I could have\\n\\nan analysis to the measure of the two investors. The first thing I did with\\n\\nmy visualization tool was to conduct a study to customers who required\\n\\nthe flagship product of the company, first I had to understand why the\\n\\ndemand had had such a strong growth in the last two months, by applying\\n\\nthe tool I could find the answers to this question; I could see that\\n\\ncustomers needed this product as it was, without any modification\\n\\nbecause the product worked wonders.\\n\\nWith this study of the clients interested in the product, I was able to\\n\\nanalyze and follow up on the proposals I had on the table from the two\\n\\ninvestors.\\n\\nI concluded that I needed the person who was interested in the first\\n\\ninstance to supply the product that was having great success. Which was\\n\\nthe second investor, since he was interested in first of all to give the size\\n\\nof production that our customers demanded, and then worry about\\n\\nimproving it, but in small and concise steps.\\n\\nI discarded the first investor, as he did not meet the requirements that the\\n\\ncompany needed at that time. I realized that this investor was convinced\\n\\nthat by changing the product to the way he thought, the demand was\\n\\ngoing to increase more; but in reality what the company needed was to be\\n\\nable to cover the demand that the product was having, this investor\\n\\nwanted to throw everything we had, to the side of the road, but he did not\\n\\nthink for a moment that these modifications should have a low impact in\\n\\ncase things do not go as well as expected.\\n\\nThanks to the application of the tool I was able to identify the key points\\n\\nof the company's needs and how each investor, according to their\\n\\nproposals, could help me, based on this I made the best decision. I chose\\n\\nto work with the second investor, we were able to supply the demand for\\n\\nthe product, then the investment tripled and we were able to inject it into\\n\\nresearch for product innovation, and make some small changes, which\\n\\nwere being introduced to customers discreetly and in small quantities.\\n\\nWhen customers became more interested in the improved product, we\\n\\ndecided to increase production by improving the product.\\n\\nPerspective\\n\\nThe information and the final lesson that I had when socializing what we\\n\\nobtained by using the visualization tool, the first thing is that we must\\n\\nalways think first about the needs of customers, of the people interested\\n\\nin the product; it is very useful to know what the problem is, what is the\\n\\ncause of the problem and finally build an effective solution. Secondly,\\n\\nbased on what we have obtained, we can find a partner that fits our\\n\\nneeds, and be able to work as a team, unifying ideas and producing\\n\\npossible solutions. Thanks to the knowledge gained from the design\\n\\ncourse, I was able to create a strategic plan for the company's problems\\n\\nand make it a successful plan.\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nWhat I would apply differently in the challenge would be the tool used, I\\n\\nwould like to use the learning launch; I would do it in the following way,\\n\\nrejecting the proposals of the two investors and only creating the way that\\n\\nthe production process would be decreased to be able to supply the\\n\\nrequired demand. It may or may not work out, but I would like to have\\n\\nemployed this strategy.\\n\\n</td>\n",

              "      <td>Assignment:  Visualization Reflection  Submitted by: Nadine Born  Course:  Design Thinking for Innovation    Trail Challenge: To Build or Not to Build    An environmental charity wanted to conduct a fundraising campaign to raise $4 million to build a  public path in a busy tourist area of a small town in British Columbia, Canada. They had been gifted a  large piece of land by a local landowner, which was a substantial gift and prevented them from  needing to purchase the land, however, they still needed to raise a large amount of money in order to  pay for the supplies and labor to build the trail.     Even though the local community appeared to be supportive of the trail, they could not provide  enough money from private donations to build it. If the summer vacation property owners did not  provide some funding, then there was a strong possibility that they would not raise enough money to  complete the trail. The charity did not know if the community as a whole would support the project  and needed to conduct testing with key influencers and potential donors to gauge their interest.  Building the trail without testing the support first was too risky because the charity did not have  enough money in reserve to cover the cost of the trail if the fundraising efforts were not successful.     Tool Selection: Visualization    Visualization is the process of “assembling scattered ideas into a compelling story that can generate  vivid mental images” (Designing for Growth, p49).  As the consultant for the study, I chose  visualization because the charity had a firm concept of why they needed the trail, how it would  benefit the town, and how much it would cost but needed a persuasive way to tie it all together. The  business case for the project was strong but without a tool to help them illustrate how the trail would  positively impact the residents, there was little chance people would donate enough to meet the  budget. We needed a tool that provided a “head and heart” message to convince people to support  the project. Visualization provided the perfect combination of key messaging, beautiful photography,  architectural renderings, safety data, and budget criteria to create the vision for the project in an  easy‐to‐read document that was only four pages in length. Visualization allowed us to describe the  urgent and compelling need for the trail in a succinct and tangible way.     Application    Once we drafted the vision document, we worked with the charity to identify a list of people whose  opinion would be important to the success (or failure) of the fundraising campaign. The list included  past and potential donors, key influencers in the community such as large landowners and business  owners, affluent summer‐only residents, and elected officials. We requested one‐hour meetings with  all of the people on the list. If people did not want to meet with us in person, which was often the\\n\\ncase with the part‐time residents, we offered to conduct the meetings by phone. When someone  agreed to meet with us, we emailed them the vision document so they could read it in advance and  prepare their questions. This created a good environment for an informed and candid dialogue.    While the scheduling of the interviews was in progress, we designed a questionnaire to guide our  discussions. Consistently using the questionnaire ensured that we covered the same questions with all  the interviewees. The goal was to speak with 20 – 25 key influencers in the community and gauge  their interest in, or opposition to, supporting the fundraising efforts for the trail as either donors or  campaign volunteers or both. We successfully met with 24 interviewees and compiled the feedback  into a summary report along with recommendations for the charity. The entire process took three  months.    Insight    Fundraising and design thinking both require a willingness to adapt and fail fast. Good fundraisers are  responsive to their donors and design thinking serves as the perfect platform to plan and launch new  fundraising initiatives; it is an ideal methodology for solving complex philanthropic issues. We are not  formally taught design thinking models in fundraising classes but they should be added to the  curriculum.     Although it is not explicitly stated in the course videos, it occurred to me that both fundraising and  design thinking are rooted in communication and relationships and both are iterative processes based  on testing and investigation. The elusive synergy between art and science is as beautifully illustrated  by design thinking as it is as inherent in daily fundraising practice.      Improvements for Next Time    Visualization was an effective tool in this circumstance and I would use it again in a similar situation.  However, it would also be enlightening to create a journey map with a wide spectrum of people from  the town because there were many assumptions made during the visualization process about how the  trail would be used and what benefits would be desired by the tourists, local public, and sponsors.  Journey mapping would have confirmed the validity of those assumptions and supplemented the data  gathered during the interviews.     The other tool that I would use next time in conjunction with visualization is storytelling. I would take  someone’s first hand account of the situation and create a short video to showcase the urgency of the  project or program from his/her perspective. A link to the video would be included in the email about  the interview along with a PDF of the vision document. I think this would provide a holistic micro and  macro perspective to the exercise and spark some interesting conversations in the interviews.\\n\\n</td>\n",

As a result of the codvid pandemic and  the restrictions that are in place until now, sales fell. delivery personnel had to be fired and operations  slowed down. There are restrictions for the sale of products in store. Although deliveries are made at  home and at no additional cost, sales do not go up. The option to reduce the price of the product was not  an option, there had been product promotions without great variations in sales    THE SELECTION     We provide solutions through the design thinking method with the aim of increasing sales. but lacking  quantitative information, we opted for a journey map as a tool. We carry out the research with regular  customers of the products. The journey map was done with 4 costumers.      THE APPLICATION     For the application of the jurney map we contacted frequent clients, who through interviews via ZOOM  could not be face-to-face due to bio-security measures, key questions were asked and they were used to  show the benefits of the products. The discoveries when talking directly with our clients generated several  hypotheses. We were somehow advancing what would be WHAT IF ?.  The results generated in the  interviews and through the journal map we were able to do interviews every other day, for a week 15  minutes. the new normal allows us to be flexible in our research methods.  In a next meeting and with the  results obtained, we opted for some ideas for rapid implementation.      INSIGHT &amp; APPROACH    The information collected from our clients was very valuable. Despite the quarantine, they continued to  buy the products.\\n\\n•  underlying diseases (reunatism, joint pain)\\n\\n•  Being natural products, our clients felt that they were better than chemical ones.\\n\\n•  Customers knew that the products we sold were fortified with VITAMINS A B C E D OMEGA  3.\\n\\n•  in times of codvid,  is necessary to reinforce the immune system with vitamins.\\n\\nThey valued that the delivery personnel have biosecurity measures in the deliveries of the product.    The data we obtained led us to make the decision to make a change in communication on social networks,  which is the channel through which more sales are made.    We made multimedia material showing the staff making the deliveries with all the biosafety measures, we  made more emphasis on the consumption of the product as a vitamin supplement, which in addition to  doing good for basic diseases were reinforced with vitamins.    Carrying out these two actions obtained from the journey maps and interviews with clients, they gave us  enough feedback and insights to better analyze how to arrive objectively in the communication of the  product.    Although we have not yet had an exponential increase in sales, the level of inquiries about potential  customers has risen, which indicates that we are on the right track. The non-traditional tools that design  thinking gives us are applicable and flexible even for small businesses such as my wife.\\n\\n</td>\n",

              "      <td>Why Mind Mapping?\\n\\nMind maps are graphical representations of information. In contrast to the  traditional, linear notes you might make in a text document or even on paper,  mind maps let you capture thoughts, ideas and keywords on a blank canvas.  These ideas are organized in a two-dimensional structure, with the title/main  idea always located in the center of the map for visibility. Related ideas branch  off from the center in all directions, creating a radiant structure.\\n\\nDespite these key principles, the fact that mind mapping has existed for almost  half a century makes it inevitable that some divergence will exist when it comes  to defining what a mind map actually is.\\n\\nmind mapping is a particular technique that requires the following key elements  to be effective:\\n\\n• A central image, to stimulate memory, associations and thought\\n\\nprocesses\\n\\n• Curvilinear branches, emanating from the central image, to depict\\n\\nthe basic ordering ideas (BOIs)\\n\\n• A (theoretically infinite) network of smaller branches to depict ideas\\n\\nstemming from the BOIs at different levels of detail\\n\\n• Conscious use of color to separate ideas by topic\\n\\n• A single keyword for each branch\\n\\nMany purists argue to this day that his method remains the one true technique:  a map without the elements above cannot be considered a “true” mind map.\\n\\nWhen it comes to creating your mind map, the most important things to  consider are what you need and how you learn best. Sometimes, you may not  even need a mind map at all. While almost all mapping techniques were  developed as an alternative to long-form text and linear notes, there are plenty  of situations where linear note-taking is a perfectly suitable method.\\n\\nYour needs and goals should also be considered when you decide how to create  the mind map itself. While traditional paper mind maps are great for developing  ideas by yourself, the development of online mind mapping tools has enabled  millions of people to brainstorm and plan together in real time. It’s for this  reason that MindMeister, our very own online mind mapping tool, features such  an intense focus on collaboration and group work.\\n\\n</td>\n",

              "      <td>Challenge\\n\\nSo, a few months back, I had chosen to intern with a start-up that was just three months old  to understand the nitty-gritty of the initial phases of an organization set-up. We were given  the challenge to formulate a Business plan. The challenges they faced were Brand positioning,  market penetration, and customer segmentation of the target market. As the start-up was  targeting a very niche market, there wasn’t much data available on the same. So, we faced a  challenge wherein no other similar business was in-place to take as a reference. The outline  of the project was to get candidates specifically from PSU (Government-run organization) to  enroll for the mentorship program to pursue higher education\\n\\nSelection\\n\\nDue to a lack of data and a similar business model, we realized that Storytelling would be a  crucial tool in conveying our project effectively. We felt that we need to ignite and unite our  mentors to make our customers believe. We also felt that connecting with people and their  emotions, as conveyed in the Storytelling tool video, would enable us to understand them  better and our project as well.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nSince there was no data available with us, we decided to perform some research and generate  our data by interviewing some immediate stakeholders like current PSU employees and  mentors since mentors have traversed through the same path. We found many crucial  insights through this activity. We also got some hard facts based on which we started to build  some recommendations. By the time we came up with some suggestions, we had realized we  need to build suspense to develop their interest. Therefore, we started re-collecting the  “Ahaa” moments that we experienced while solving problems related to various aspects of  the B-plan discussed above. We began to design our presentation by making a concerted  effort to get our audience in the frame of mind, which we required them to be.\\n\\nThrough these insights and planned efforts, we were able to deliver a presentation that  connected with our mentors who had been through a similar path. Before addressing every  problem (Brand positioning, market penetration, and customer segmentation of the target  market), we built suspense before addressing that issue. Hence, our panelists were always  interested and on the edge of their seats. Due to this, we were able to deliver an effective  solution to our panelists and deliver it in a way that connected well with the mentors as well.  We eventually won a pre-placement offer from the start-up.\\n\\nInsights\\n\\nAfter the presentation, we saw that some other submissions had similar recommendations,  but the way we designed and conveyed our work, in the form of a story with spikes laid out  in between, was admired and valued by the panelists and mentors. Hence, we realized that  the effective communication of an idea plays a vital role in conveying an idea.\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nAfter completing the course, I realized that we could have used Mind-mapping in conjunction  with Storytelling, which could have aligned our thoughts in a better way, and we could have  come up with better insights through structured thinking.\\n\\n</td>\n",

              "      <td>Brainstorming\\n\\nChallenge &amp; Selection\\n\\nBrainstorming is a very powerful method for generating ideas that can solve a problem at the  early stage of a design process. Its purpose is to invoke uninhibited thoughts and it can be  practiced by an individual or a group of people. Group should meet in a comfortable  environment equipped with stationery and feel free to throw any idea or thought, even those  that might seem ridiculous. It is very important that group is diverse and consist of people from  a wide range of backgrounds. Although this method focuses on quantity rather than quality,  creativity of ideas is highly desirable. Most important advantages of this technique are that  many ideas can be generated in a short time period, great deal of them can be put aside for  later projects, and it doesn’t require lots of resources.\\n\\nWhen my team faced the challenge to create a new, motivating mobile application that will  inspire users to set and accomplish their goals in life, this method proved to be an excellent  method to set the foundations. Team itself was consist of members from different parts of the  world and that also played pivotal role in the design process. All of my peers were familiar with  applications that were trying to solve the same problem statement: People tend to set goals to  improve their lives but very few manage to accomplish them. Since there were several similar  applications on the market already, the biggest challenge was to determine what can we do to  make our app better than the others. We found the answer to that question during the  brainstorming session, along with the ideas for several more features that will motivate users  and make our product stand out from the others.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nDuring the brainstorming session team generated lots of creative ideas. Then we organized  them into groups and subgroups in order to analyze all generated data. Having ideas organized  like that, it was much easier to evaluate them, compare them with the current state of the art,  predict their cost and feasibility, and finally, decide on which ones were the best. We came up  with the key solution to our problem statement. What we needed to make our app successful  was the instrument of encouragement. We also figured out how to motivate our users  gradually, which was very important because it usually takes time to accomplish a goal.\\n\\nInsight &amp; Approach\\n\\nBrainstorming is a technique that never failed me in my experience so far. In this particular case  it had provided me and my team with lots of creative ideas which helped us form a set of  features for a new mobile application that can stand fresh and original against what was  currently on the market. Brainstorming method fosters collaboration, creativity, and  productivity. To ensure a successful outcome it is good to have an experienced  moderator to facilitate the session. Experienced moderator will know how to encourage  participants to come up with more ideas and how to build up on them. He will also keep in  mind that it is very important to have a well defined problem statement, and make sure that  focus stays on users that the group is trying to solve the problem for. That is something that we,  as we were unexperienced designers at that time, didn’t know. Although we had defined the  problem statement and kept focus on it, we could have completed a successful brainstorming  session in much less time if we had had an experienced facilitator to lead our group.\\n\\n</td>\n",

              "      <td>Mind Mapping\\n\\nChallenge\\n\\nMy consulting teammates and I, specialized in analyzing business concerns and finding the best solutions  for their problems, were assigned to a project which consisted on investigating which are the key issues  that determine the well-being of the employees in the auditing department of a multinational company,  with the aim of pursuing the increase of level of happiness among the workforce environment.\\n\\nThe reason why we were asked to carry out this research is because the department to investigate is  recently reporting high employee stress and unsatisfaction, after suffering heavy work waves with  numerous demands concerning firm auditing after the break of the Covid-19 economic crisis. We have a  pretty short deadline to face this challenge, so we are thinking about testing all employees of the  department in one unique experiment.\\n\\nSelection\\n\\nOut of all design thinking tools that we could use in order to find an approach that shows us the way to  increase employee wellbeing, we have decided to use the mind mapping tool. This design thinking tool is  the most appropriate when the experiment aims at finding patterns in given data among the surveyed  people. What we want to extract with this method is a group of several personalities when thinking  about the key issues for corporate wellbeing, just as we saw in the MeYou Health Story in the Design  Thinking course.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nIn order to apply the mind-mapping tool in an effective manner, we handed out to all employees a blank  piece of paper and told them to draw an eight-portion pizza. Each of these portions had to be filled in  with a factor that the participant considered mostly essential for his/her wellbeing among the auditing  department, out of eight factors we listed to them. This means that the employees had to write eight  factors on each of their pizzas but, in case of considering one of those elements more important than  others, that element could be written in more than one portion, according to how critical it is in  comparison to the rest. The eight factors the participants had to consider for their portions were: career  potential, salary, balance with personal life, vacation periods, training financed by the firm, transport  provision to go to the office and return to home, the provision of meal tickets and other benefits of  working at the company such as online shopping discounts.\\n\\nAfter completing this task, the employees were ordered to gather in groups of six people and discuss  about why each of them had reached their conclusions about giving more importance to some factors  than others.\\n\\nInsights\\n\\nOnce the whole process mentioned above was finished, we found out that there were interesting  results, as patterns of data existed among the selected elements. We concluded that there were  different types of employee preferences, as those that selected career potential also tended to choose  salary and training paid by the firm. These employees, therefore, could be classified as a first prototype  of worker, which are more worried about having a successful professional career, rather than other  benefits.\\n\\nAnother clear pattern was showed when observing that those who chose balance with personal life  tended to also select vacation periods and transport to go and return from the office. We could  conclude, therefore, that this type of employee worries mostly about having time to spend with their  family. Finally, there were people that selected a mix of these elements, mainly the four most chosen  factors: balance with personal life, salary, vacation periods and career potential. The elements that were  less considered among candidates were transport provision and other benefits such as shopping  discounts.\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nI believe that this tool was accurate for measuring what people consider important for their wellbeing in  their company, because it gave us different points of view since we drew conclusions concerning diverse  kinds of personalities. Despite this, another valid tool that could fit in this experiment is visualization,  where pictures of a successful manager or a happy family would be shown, in order to see which result  more attractive for the candidates and conclusions would be drawn by stating the factors determining  wellbeing mentioned before, representing the opposite order of the process explained above.\\n\\n</td>\n",

              "top     Design Thinking for innovation reflexion-Avril 2021-Nathalie Sylla\\n\\nChallenge & selection\\n\\nThe tool I use to help all stakeholders finding their way through the complexity of a project is the  mind map.\\n\\nWhat exactly is a mind map? According to the definition of Buzan T. and Buzan B. (1999, Dessine-moi  l'intelligence. Paris: Les Éditions d'Organisation.), the mind map (or heuristic diagram) is a graphic  representation technique that follows the natural functioning of the mind and allows the brain's  potential to be released. Cf Annex1\\n\\nThis tool has many advantages:\\n\\n•  It is accessible to all and does not require significant material investment and can be done  quickly\\n\\n•  It is scalable\\n\\n•  It allows categorization and linking of information\\n\\n•  It can be applied to any type of situation: notetaking, problem solving, analysis, creation of  new ideas\\n\\n•  It is suitable for all people and is easy to learn\\n\\n•  It is fun and encourages exchanges\\n\\n•  It makes visible the dimension of projects, opportunities, interconnections\\n\\n•  It synthesizes\\n\\n•  It makes the project understandable\\n\\n•  It allows you to explore ideas\\n\\nThe creation of a mind map starts with an idea/problem located at its center. This starting point  generates ideas/work areas, incremented around this center in a radial structure, which in turn is  completed with as many branches as new ideas.\\n\\nThis tool enables creativity and logic to be mobilized, it is a map of the thoughts.\\n\\nCreativity is enhanced because participants feel comfortable with the method.\\n\\nApplication & Insight\\n\\nI start the process of the mind map creation with the stakeholders standing around a large board  (white or paper board). In the center of the board, I write and highlight the topic to design.\\n\\nThrough a series of questions, I guide the stakeholders in modelling the mind map. I adapt the series  of questions according to the topic to be addressed. In the type of questions, we can use: who, what,  when, where, why, how, how much.\\n\\nThe use of the “why” is very interesting to understand the origin. By this way, the interviewed person  frees itself from paradigms and thus dares to propose new ideas / ways of functioning. I plan two  hours for a workshop.\\n\\nDesign Thinking for innovation reflexion-Avril 2021-Nathalie Sylla\\n\\nAfter modelling the mind map on paper, I propose to the participants a digital visualization of their  work with the addition of color codes, images and interconnections. This second workshop also lasts  two hours and allows the mind map to evolve. Once familiarized with it, the stakeholders discover  the power of the tool. Then, the second workshop brings out even more ideas and constructive  exchanges between the stakeholders. Around this new mind map, they have learned to work  together and want to make visible the untold ideas.\\n\\nI now present all the projects I manage in this type of format in order to ease rapid understanding for  decision-makers. These presentations are the core of my business models. The decision-makers are  thus able to identify the opportunities of the projects and can take quick decisions to validate them.  They find answers to their questions thank to a schematic representation.\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nWhat I find amazing with the facilitation of this type of workshop is the participants commitment for  the project. This tool helps to give meaning. The participants appropriate the story and want to keep  writing it. Then, they easily become actors or sponsors of the project. A trust relationship is built,  thus facilitating the implementation of related actions.\\n\\nDesign Thinking for innovation reflexion-Avril 2021-Nathalie Sylla\\n\\nAnnex 1: Mind Map Shared facilities project\\n\\n   \n",

According to the definition of Buzan T. and Buzan B. (1999, Dessine-moi  l'intelligence. Paris: Les Éditions d'Organisation.), the mind map (or heuristic diagram) is a graphic  representation technique that follows the natural functioning of the mind and allows the brain's  potential to be released. Cf Annex1\\n\\nThis tool has many advantages:\\n\\n•  It is accessible to all and does not require significant material investment and can be done  quickly\\n\\n•  It is scalable\\n\\n•  It allows categorization and linking of information\\n\\n•  It can be applied to any type of situation: notetaking, problem solving, analysis, creation of  new ideas\\n\\n•  It is suitable for all people and is easy to learn\\n\\n•  It is fun and encourages exchanges\\n\\n•  It makes visible the dimension of projects, opportunities, interconnections\\n\\n•  It synthesizes\\n\\n•  It makes the project understandable\\n\\n•  It allows you to explore ideas\\n\\nThe creation of a mind map starts with an idea/problem located at its center. This starting point  generates ideas/work areas, incremented around this center in a radial structure, which in turn is  completed with as many branches as new ideas.\\n\\nThis tool enables creativity and logic to be mobilized, it is a map of the thoughts.\\n\\nCreativity is enhanced because participants feel comfortable with the method.\\n\\nApplication &amp; Insight\\n\\nI start the process of the mind map creation with the stakeholders standing around a large board  (white or paper board). In the center of the board, I write and highlight the topic to design.\\n\\nThrough a series of questions, I guide the stakeholders in modelling the mind map. I adapt the series  of questions according to the topic to be addressed. In the type of questions, we can use: who, what,  when, where, why, how, how much.\\n\\nThe use of the “why” is very interesting to understand the origin. By this way, the interviewed person  frees itself from paradigms and thus dares to propose new ideas / ways of functioning. I plan two  hours for a workshop.\\n\\nDesign Thinking for innovation reflexion-Avril 2021-Nathalie Sylla\\n\\nAfter modelling the mind map on paper, I propose to the participants a digital visualization of their  work with the addition of color codes, images and interconnections. This second workshop also lasts  two hours and allows the mind map to evolve. Once familiarized with it, the stakeholders discover  the power of the tool. Then, the second workshop brings out even more ideas and constructive  exchanges between the stakeholders. Around this new mind map, they have learned to work  together and want to make visible the untold ideas.\\n\\nI now present all the projects I manage in this type of format in order to ease rapid understanding for  decision-makers. These presentations are the core of my business models. The decision-makers are  thus able to identify the opportunities of the projects and can take quick decisions to validate them.  They find answers to their questions thank to a schematic representation.\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nWhat I find amazing with the facilitation of this type of workshop is the participants commitment for  the project. This tool helps to give meaning. The participants appropriate the story and want to keep  writing it. Then, they easily become actors or sponsors of the project. A trust relationship is built,  thus facilitating the implementation of related actions.\\n\\nDesign Thinking for innovation reflexion-Avril 2021-Nathalie Sylla\\n\\nAnnex 1: Mind Map Shared facilities project\\n\\n</td>\n",
